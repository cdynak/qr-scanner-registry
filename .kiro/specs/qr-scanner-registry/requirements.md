# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The QR Scanner Registry is a web application that allows users to authenticate with Google, scan QR codes and barcodes using their device camera, and store scan results in a database. The application will be built with Astro 5, React 19, TypeScript, and Supabase as the backend, with comprehensive testing using Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for end-to-end tests. The project will include automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in with my Google account, so that I can securely access the QR scanning functionality and have my scans associated with my identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a "Login with Google" button
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Login with Google" button THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google OAuth authentication
3. WHEN a user successfully authenticates with Google THEN the system SHALL create or retrieve their user profile from Supabase
4. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display their profile information and provide access to scanning functionality
5. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL restrict access to scanning features
6. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect to the login page

### Requirement 2: QR/Barcode Scanning

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to scan QR codes and barcodes using my device camera, so that I can capture and store the encoded information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the scanning page THEN the system SHALL request camera permissions
2. WHEN camera permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL display a live camera feed with scanning overlay
3. WHEN a QR code or barcode is detected in the camera view THEN the system SHALL automatically decode the content
4. WHEN a code is successfully scanned THEN the system SHALL display the decoded content to the user
5. WHEN a scan is completed THEN the system SHALL provide options to save or rescan
6. IF camera permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message with instructions
7. WHEN scanning fails or times out THEN the system SHALL provide retry options

### Requirement 3: Scan Data Storage

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my scan results to be automatically saved to a database, so that I can access my scan history and manage my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully scans a code THEN the system SHALL automatically save the scan data to Supabase
2. WHEN saving scan data THEN the system SHALL store the decoded content, scan timestamp, user ID, and scan type (QR/barcode)
3. WHEN a scan is saved THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation to the user
4. WHEN a user views their scan history THEN the system SHALL display all their previous scans in chronological order
5. WHEN displaying scan history THEN the system SHALL show scan content, timestamp, and scan type
6. IF saving fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide retry options
7. WHEN a user deletes a scan THEN the system SHALL remove it from the database and update the display

### Requirement 4: Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage with unit and end-to-end tests, so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN the system SHALL test all business logic, utilities, and components using Vitest
2. WHEN end-to-end tests are executed THEN the system SHALL test complete user workflows using Playwright
3. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage for critical functionality
4. WHEN authentication is tested THEN the system SHALL mock Google OAuth and verify user flows
5. WHEN scanning functionality is tested THEN the system SHALL mock camera input and verify scan processing
6. WHEN database operations are tested THEN the system SHALL use test database instances or mocking
7. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information

### Requirement 5: Continuous Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing on every commit, so that I can catch issues early and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to any branch THEN GitHub Actions SHALL automatically run all tests
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL run tests and block merging if tests fail
3. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL allow the pull request to be merged
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure information in the PR
5. WHEN the main branch is updated THEN the system SHALL run a full test suite including E2E tests
6. WHEN CI runs THEN the system SHALL test against the same Node.js version specified in .nvmrc
7. IF CI fails THEN the system SHALL notify developers through GitHub notifications
